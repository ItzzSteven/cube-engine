Using Cubity Script

functions

2d:

movement_2d(object,speed)

replace object with the sprite without file extension speed is the x and y movement speed
move_sprite is not it a loop so it only moves sprite once to fix this do:

python code:

# movement code in cs
while True:
    move_sprite(player,1,1)
    if keyboard.is.pressed("q") :
        break

spawn_sprite(sprite,x,y)
replace sprite with the file name of your sprite with file extension

check_collision(firstsprite,secondsprite)
replace firstsprite with the a sprite and same for second sprite but it need to be a different sprite 
and then it will detect collision

move_sprite(sprite,xspeed,yspeed)
replace sprite with your sprite and xspeed and yspeed with the x and y speed you want the sprite to move

3D
NOTE:
3D is not availible yet because i am currently working on cubegl
because i want cubity to be lightweight and work on potato pc`s 
and older pc`c also because im coding with a dell latitude e6400
that doesnt support pyopengl or at least i dont know how to use it
